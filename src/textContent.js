    Hello! My name is Victor Chen, and I am a recent computer science graduate from UC Berkeley. 
    With that, I currently aspire to work as a software engineer where I will be developing tools and features for 
    large-scale applications. Since high school, I've been passionate about learning and innovating within the technological field.
    Whether it's designing games, implementing general-use software applications, or tinkering with different parameters and techniques for data science/machine learning models, this experimentation with code and its related concepts puts my creativity to work. And this sentiment has remained unchanged in the span of my college career.
    This past summer, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Emotewell 
    where I worked on backend features related to user image uploads, improving website security and efficiency, 
    and automating certain processes within the company.
    Having graduated in December 2023, I aspire to work as a software engineer. 
    Recently I started to work on my full-stack-based side project as a hobby, 
    with my stack being Python (Django) for the backend and Javascript (React) for the frontend.
    Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to share any thoughts. I'm open to chat!ðŸ¤—`;
